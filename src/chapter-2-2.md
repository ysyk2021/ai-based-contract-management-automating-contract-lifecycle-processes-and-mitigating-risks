Introduction
------------

In this chapter, we explore the traditional approaches to contract management that have been prevalent before the advent of AI-based solutions. These approaches highlight the manual processes, challenges, and limitations that organizations have faced in managing contracts manually. Understanding these traditional approaches provides a context for embracing AI technologies and leveraging their advantages in automating contract lifecycle processes.

Manual Contract Creation and Negotiation
----------------------------------------

### Drafting Contracts

Traditionally, contracts were created manually through a labor-intensive process involving lawyers or legal professionals. The drafting phase required significant time and effort, with contracts being crafted from scratch based on business requirements and legal considerations.

### Negotiating Terms and Conditions

Contract negotiation involved multiple rounds of back-and-forth discussions between parties to reach mutually agreeable terms and conditions. Communication was typically conducted through emails, phone calls, or in-person meetings, often resulting in delays and difficulties in tracking changes accurately.

Paper-Based Documentation and Storage
-------------------------------------

### Physical Copies

Contracts were predominantly stored as physical copies, leading to challenges in organizing, retrieving, and tracking contract information. Managing large volumes of paper documents required extensive storage space, increasing the risk of misplacement, damage, or loss.

### Limited Accessibility

With paper-based systems, accessing and sharing contract information was cumbersome and time-consuming. Parties involved in contract management had limited real-time visibility into contract status or updates, hindering collaboration and timely decision-making.

Manual Review Processes
-----------------------

### Reviewing Clauses and Terms

Traditional contract management relied on manual reviews of contract clauses and terms. Legal professionals would meticulously examine contracts to ensure compliance, identify potential risks, and make necessary revisions. This process was often time-consuming and prone to human errors.

### Compliance Monitoring

Ensuring compliance with contractual obligations and regulatory requirements relied on manual tracking and monitoring. Organizations had to dedicate resources to continuously review contracts, track deadlines, and manage compliance-related tasks, which were prone to oversight and delays.

Lack of Automation and Integration
----------------------------------

### Workflow Inefficiencies

Traditional approaches often suffered from workflow inefficiencies due to the reliance on manual processes. The lack of automation resulted in longer contract turnaround times, increased administrative burdens, and reduced operational efficiency.

### Limited Integration with Systems

Contract management was often siloed, with minimal integration with other business systems, such as customer relationship management (CRM) or enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. This limited integration hindered data sharing, collaboration, and overall process optimization.

Conclusion
----------

Traditional approaches to contract management relied heavily on manual processes, paper-based documentation, and limited automation. These approaches posed numerous challenges, including time-consuming tasks, difficulties in storage and accessibility, manual review processes, and lack of automation and integration. Recognizing these limitations provides a foundation for organizations to embrace AI-based contract management solutions, which can automate processes, streamline workflows, enhance visibility, and mitigate risks effectively. By leveraging AI technologies, organizations can overcome the drawbacks of traditional approaches and optimize their contract lifecycle management processes for improved efficiency and effectiveness.
