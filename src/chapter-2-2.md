Traditional Approaches to Contract Management
=========================================================================================

Contract management is a critical process for businesses of all sizes and industries. Traditional approaches to contract management involve manual processes that can be time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. In this chapter, we will explore the key components of traditional approaches to contract management.

Key Components of Traditional Approaches to Contract Management
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Contract Creation

Under traditional approaches to contract management, contract creation involves manually drafting contracts that clearly define the terms and conditions of agreements between parties. This can include negotiating terms with counterparties, creating contract templates, and ensuring legal compliance.

### Contract Execution

Contract execution under traditional approaches to contract management involves obtaining signatures from all parties involved and ensuring that all relevant stakeholders are informed of the executed contract. This can include storing executed contracts in a central location and notifying stakeholders of important dates and deadlines related to contract performance.

### Contract Performance

Contract performance under traditional approaches to contract management involves monitoring adherence to contract terms and conditions. This can include tracking KPIs related to contract performance, identifying areas for improvement, and mitigating risk associated with non-compliance or breaches of contract.

### Contract Analysis

Contract analysis under traditional approaches to contract management involves reviewing contracts to identify opportunities for improvement and risk mitigation. This can include analyzing contract terms and conditions, identifying bottlenecks in negotiation workflows, and monitoring adherence to regulatory and legal requirements.

Limitations of Traditional Approaches to Contract Management
------------------------------------------------------------

Traditional approaches to contract management have several limitations, including reliance on manual processes, lack of automation, and data fragmentation. These limitations can lead to inefficiencies, errors, and increased risk associated with non-compliance or breaches of contract.
