In today's fast-paced business environment, contract management is a critical process that requires a great deal of effort and attention to detail. Contracts are the backbone of any business relationship, and effectively managing them is essential to ensuring compliance, mitigating risks, and maintaining positive relationships with stakeholders. As businesses continue to grow and become more complex, traditional methods of contract management have become increasingly outdated and inefficient.

However, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have created new opportunities for businesses to streamline their contract management processes and mitigate risks. AI-based contract management solutions can automate many of the tasks associated with contract lifecycle processes, such as contract creation, negotiation, execution, and performance monitoring. These solutions can help businesses reduce legal and financial risks, ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and improve overall efficiency.

The objective of this book is to provide a comprehensive overview of AI-based contract management, including its applications, benefits, challenges, and future directions. Legal professionals, business leaders, and technology experts who are interested in leveraging AI technologies to streamline their contract management workflows, reduce risks, and ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements will find this book useful.

By covering a broad range of topics related to AI-based contract management, this book aims to provide a comprehensive resource for businesses looking to leverage AI technologies to improve their contract management workflows, reduce risks, and ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
